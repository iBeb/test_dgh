Explain how the view and the controller will react when:
	the user sends a feedback using the first form,
	the user saves the changes he made on the second form,
	describe what could possibly not work as expected or fail,

- The action is missing in both forms so there will be an error message when the submit button is clicked.
In the case that there were no errors, once the form is submited, the controller will redirect the user to 'manage/user/', if there are no errors.
